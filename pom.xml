            This fork adds the following SAX feature:

	    http://www.ccil.org/~cowan/tagsoup/features/suppress-namespaces

            A value of "true" disables namespace reporting in a way that
            maintains compatibility with applications that expect a namespace
            aware parser.  Specifically, the namespace of elements is reported
            as "", and the localname is reported as same as QName. Also, it
            suppresses tagsoup's default behavior of sending startPrefixMapping
            and endPrefixMapping events for the mapping of prefix 'html' to
            namespace 'http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'.

            Original descripion:
            TagSoup is a SAX-compliant parser written in Java that, instead of
            parsing well-formed or valid XML, parses HTML as it is found in the
            wild: poor, nasty and brutish, though quite often far from short.
            TagSoup is designed for people who have to process this stuff using
            some semblance of a rational application design. By providing a SAX
            interface, it allows standard XML tools to be applied to even the
            worst HTML. TagSoup also includes a command-line processor that
            reads HTML files and can generate either clean HTML or well-formed
            XML that is a close approximation to XHTML.
